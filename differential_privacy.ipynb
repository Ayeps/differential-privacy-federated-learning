Each row corresponds to a person. Each value corresponds to whether or not that person has a certain private attribute (such as whether they have a certain disease, or whether they are above/below a certain age). We are then going to learn how to know whether a database query over such a small database is differentially private or not - and more importantly - what techniques are at our disposal to ensure various levels of privacy\n",

If they answer \"Yes\" to the question \"have you committed X crime?\", then it might becasue they actually did, or it might be because they are answering according to a random coin flip. Each person has a high degree of protection. Furthermore, we can recover the underlying statistics with some accuracy, as the \"true statistics\" are simply averaged with a 50% probability. Thus, if we collect a bunch of samples and it turns out that 60% of people answer yes, then we know that the TRUE distribution is actually centered around 70%, because 70% averaged with a 50% (a coin flip) is 60% which is the result we obtained. \n",

    "# Differential Privacy for Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does all of this have to do with Deep Learning? Well, these mechanisms form the core primitives for how Differential Privacy provides guarantees in the context of Deep Learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Perfect Privacy\n",
    "> \"a query to a database returns the same value even if we remove any person from the database\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Deep Learning, we have a similar standard. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Training a model on a dataset should return the same model even if we remove any person from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we've replaced \"querying a database\" with \"training a model on a dataset\". In essence, the training process is a kind of query. However, one should note that this adds two points of complexity which database queries did not have:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. do we always know where \"people\" are referenced in the dataset?\n",
    "    2. neural models rarely never train to the same output model, even on identical data\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to (1) is to treat each training example as a single, separate person. Strictly speaking, this is often overly zealous as some training examples have no relevance to people and others may have multiple/partial (consider an image with multiple people contained within it). Thus, localizing exactly where \"people\" are referenced, and thus how much your model would change if people were removed, is challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to (2) is also an open problem. To solve this, lets look at PATE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario: A Health Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "You work for a hospital and you have a large collection of images about your patients. However, you don't know what's in them. You would like to use these images to develop a neural network which can automatically classify them, however since your images aren't labeled, they aren't sufficient to train a classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, being a cunning strategist, you realize that you can reach out to 10 partner hospitals which have annotated data. It is your hope to train your new classifier on their datasets so that you can automatically label your own. While these hospitals are interested in helping, they have privacy concerns regarding information about their patients. Thus, you will use the following technique to train a classifier which protects the privacy of patients in the other hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1) You'll ask each of the 10 hospitals to train a model on their own datasets (All of which have the same kinds of labels)\n",
    "- 2) You'll then use each of the 10 partner models to predict on your local dataset, generating 10 labels for each of your datapoints\n",
    "- 3) Then, for each local data point (now with 10 labels), you will perform a DP query to generate the final true label. This query is a \"max\" function, where \"max\" is the most frequent label across the 10 labels. We will need to add laplacian noise to make this Differentially Private to a certain epsilon/delta constraint.\n",
    "- 4) Finally, we will retrain a new model on our local dataset which now has labels. This will be our final \"DP\" model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's walk through these steps. I will assume you're already familiar with how to train/predict a deep neural network, so we'll skip steps 1 and 2 and work with example data. We'll focus instead on step 3, namely how to perform the DP query for each example using toy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's say we have 10,000 training examples, and we've got 10 labels for each example (from our 10 \"teacher models\" which were trained directly on private data). Each label is chosen from a set of 10 possible labels (categories) for each image."
