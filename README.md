# Differential Privacy & Federated Learning.
Curated notebooks on how to train neural networks using differential privacy and federated learning.

## What is differential privacy?
Differential Privacy is a set of techniques for
preventing a model from accidentally memorizing secrets present
in a training dataset during the learning process.

The key points under Differential Privacy are:

* Make a promise to a data subject that: You wonâ€™t be affected,
  adversely or otherwise, by allowing your data to be used in any analysis,
  no matter what studies, datasets or information sources, are available.
* Ensure that the model learning from sensitive data are only learning what they are
  supposed to learn without accidentally learning what they are not supposed to learn from their data

## Federated Learning
Instead of bringing data all to one place for training,
federated learning is done by bringing the model to the data.
This allows a data owner to maintain the only copy of their information.
